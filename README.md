## 1. Introduction  
The true strength of a society often shows in how it treats its most vulnerable members. Homelessness is a telling challenge in this regard, reflecting not just the availability of shelter but broader issues like economic health and community support. Between 2007 and 2022, the story of homelessness in the U.S. has varied greatly, and not all these stories make it to the headlines.
 
This research is set against the backdrop of notable shifts in homelessness demographics. We're exploring how factors like age, gender, race, and geographical location influence patterns of homelessness. The landscape is vast: from young adults facing homelessness to elderly individuals navigating unique challenges. Notably, while some areas have successfully curtailed the rise of homelessness with innovative strategies, others find themselves battling unexpected surges. We additionally aim to spotlight regions that have excelled in their approach, serving as potential models for others.
 
An equally important facet of our study is the media's portrayal of homelessness. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we'll assess the themes present in online news articles segmented by state. By comparing these media depictions by analyzing their sentiments, against actual homelessness statistics, we aim to discern any disparities, offering a deeper understanding of potential media biases or misrepresentations.
 
To uncover these insights, we're turning to data miningâ€”we employ techniques that delve deep into large datasets to uncover patterns and trends. While we will dive deeper into our methods later, it's worth noting that our approach is comprehensive, merging hard data with narrative analysis. This ensures a holistic understanding, shedding light on both statistics and stories.
 
In essence, "Bridging Realities" is not merely a research endeavor. It seeks to empower policymakers, NGOs, urban planners, and social welfare experts with a nuanced understanding of homelessness. By challenging prevailing narratives and offering a clearer picture, we hope to inspire a renewed commitment to addressing and understanding this pressing issue.

## 2. Problem Statement  
We aim to investigate changing patterns related to homelessness from 2015 to 2022 by conducting a thorough numerical analysis of homeless counts across diverse demographics such as age, gender, race, and state. Utilizing clustering, association pattern mining, and classification models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting), we seek to identify underlying patterns and factors significantly influencing homelessness. Additionally, our study involves a text analysis of news titles related to homelessness from left-wing, neutral, and right-wing media categories. Employing sentiment analysis (BERT), word frequency, and topic modeling (LDA), we aim to assess media portrayals of homelessness across political wings. Furthermore, we seek to assess the alignment between Internet news portrayals by state and the actual circumstances of homelessness.


---

## 3. Related Work  
In recent research, machine learning and artificial intelligence have been harnessed to model complex systems, particularly within the context of homelessness. One study employs these technologies to predict returns to homelessness, examining numerous possible allocations of households to homeless services and generating reentry predictions for each combination of household and service. Additionally, it explores mathematical and theoretical optimization possibilities for the allocation process and investigates how predictions can enhance the understanding of homeless service efficacy, focusing on the case of St. Louis, MO, USA [1]. Another study contributes to addressing various critical social issues, including homelessness, through the development of data-driven algorithmic solutions. Specifically, it seeks to mitigate homelessness by devising equitable policies and data-driven strategies to connect individuals with appropriate resources, ensuring a higher likelihood of a safe and stable exit from homelessness [2]. 

Our study has been split into two parts. We first perform numerical analysis of data that consists of counts of homeless people across different demographics like age, gender, race, state, etc. We employ various algorithms like clustering, association pattern mining and employing classification models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to understand underlying patterns in the data and factors that significantly influence homelessness. The latter part of our study focuses on analysis of media headline data related to â€˜homelessâ€™, i.e., text analysis of news titles scraped from news websites belonging to three different media categories - left wing, neutral, and right wing. We perform sentiment analysis (BERT), word frequency analysis, and topic modeling (LDA) to assess media depiction of homelessness by each political wing. We finally compare the analyses from both parts, numerical and text, to discern the relationship between media sentiments and the actual state of homelessness.

# 5. Key Concepts and Background

To provide readers with a clear understanding of the technical foundation behind our analysis, this section introduces key concepts, theories, and methodologies from statistics, data mining, and data science. These are the building blocks that drive our investigation, from discovering patterns in homelessness data to interpreting media narratives.

---

## 5.1. Correlation Analysis: Quantifying Relationships

Correlation is a statistical measure that helps us understand the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. In our project, correlation analysis played a pivotal role in identifying how demographic factors like age, gender, and race relate to homelessness counts.

### The Math Behind It
The Pearson correlation coefficient \( r \) is calculated using the formula:

<div align="center">

$$
r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2} \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2}}
$$

</div>

Here:
- x_i and y_i are the values of variables X and Y,
- xÌ„ and yÌ„ are their respective means,
- n is the number of observations.

A value close to 1 indicates a strong positive relationship, -1 indicates a strong negative relationship, and 0 means no correlation.


### Why It Matters
In our study, correlation helped uncover meaningful patterns, such as the strong association between certain demographic groups (e.g., under-18 females) and sheltered homelessness.


---

## 5.2. Clustering: Unveiling Hidden Groups

Clustering is a method of grouping data points so that those in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. By applying clustering to our homelessness data, we identified demographic segments with shared characteristics, helping us pinpoint areas requiring focused intervention.

### Key Techniques
1. **The Elbow Method**:
   - Helps determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting the *Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)* and identifying the "elbow point," where adding more clusters yields diminishing returns.
<div align="center">

$$
\text{WCSS} = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{x \in C_k} ||x - \mu_k||^2
$$

</div>


2. **Hierarchical Clustering**:
   - Groups data points by successively merging the closest clusters, visualized through a dendrogram.

### Application in Our Study
Clustering revealed key demographic clusters, such as a distinct group predominantly composed of young, African American individuals. This insight highlighted systemic factors disproportionately affecting certain populations.

---

## 5.3. FP-Growth: Mining Frequent Patterns

The FP-Growth algorithm efficiently identifies frequent itemsets within large datasets, making it invaluable for discovering demographic patterns in our homelessness data.

### How It Works
1. Constructs an FP-Tree (Frequent Pattern Tree) to represent itemsets compactly.
2. Traverses the tree to extract frequent itemsets without generating candidate sets.

### What We Learned
Using FP-Growth, we identified patterns like the high co-occurrence of "Under 18" and "Sheltered" homelessness among certain racial groups. This guided further analysis into systemic issues and resource allocation.

---

## 5.4. Sentiment Analysis: Decoding Media Tone

Sentiment analysis evaluates the emotional tone of text, categorizing it as positive, negative, or neutral. In our project, we used BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to analyze thousands of media headlines and uncover trends in sentiment over time.

### Behind the Scenes
BERT processes each word in the context of the entire sentence, capturing nuances in meaning. The sentiment score is derived using a classification head attached to the model's final layer.

### Why Itâ€™s Important
Our analysis revealed that headlines often leaned "Very Negative" during periods of increasing homelessness, reflecting critical media coverage during societal crises like the pandemic.

---

## 5.5. Random Forest and Gradient Boosting: Predictive Powerhouses

To predict high versus low levels of homelessness, we employed two powerful machine learning algorithms: Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.

### Random Forest
This algorithm builds multiple decision trees and aggregates their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. Its formula is:
<div align="center">

$$
\hat{y} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i(x)
$$

</div>

Where \( f_i(x) \) is the prediction from the \( i \)-th tree.


### Gradient Boosting
Gradient Boosting builds models sequentially, optimizing the error at each step. It minimizes the loss function \( L \) using:

<div align="center">

$$
F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + h_m(x)
$$

</div>

Where \( h_m(x) \) represents the corrective model.


### Insights Gained
These algorithms highlighted critical predictors of high homelessness levels, such as "Gender - Male" and "Age - Over 18," corroborating patterns observed in the raw data.

---

## 5.6. Topic Modeling with LDA: Uncovering Themes

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a natural language processing technique that discovers underlying topics in text. In our media analysis, LDA helped us identify recurring themes in homelessness coverage.

### The Mathematics
LDA models each document as a mixture of topics and each topic as a mixture of words:

<div align="center">

$$
P(w | d) = \sum_{z} P(w | z)P(z | d)
$$

</div>

Where:
- \( P(w | z) \): Probability of word \( w \) given topic \( z \),
- \( P(z | d) \): Probability of topic \( z \) given document \( d \).


### Why Itâ€™s Insightful
By applying LDA, we uncovered themes like "pandemic-related impacts" and "policy discussions," shedding light on how media narratives evolved during key periods.
