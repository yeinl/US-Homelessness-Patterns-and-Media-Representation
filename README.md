## 1. Introduction  
The true strength of a society often shows in how it treats its most vulnerable members. Homelessness is a telling challenge in this regard, reflecting not just the availability of shelter but broader issues like economic health and community support. Between 2007 and 2022, the story of homelessness in the U.S. has varied greatly, and not all these stories make it to the headlines.

This research is set against the backdrop of notable shifts in homelessness demographics. We're exploring how factors like age, gender, race, and geographical location influence patterns of homelessness. The landscape is vast: from young adults facing homelessness to elderly individuals navigating unique challenges. Notably, while some areas have successfully curtailed the rise of homelessness with innovative strategies, others find themselves battling unexpected surges. We additionally aim to spotlight regions that have excelled in their approach, serving as potential models for others.

An equally important facet of our study is the media's portrayal of homelessness. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we'll assess the themes present in online news articles segmented by state. By comparing these media depictions, analyzing their sentiments against actual homelessness statistics, we aim to discern any disparities, offering a deeper understanding of potential media biases or misrepresentations.

To uncover these insights, we're turning to data miningâ€”employing techniques that delve deep into large datasets to uncover patterns and trends. While we will dive deeper into our methods later, it's worth noting that our approach is comprehensive, merging hard data with narrative analysis. This ensures a holistic understanding, shedding light on both statistics and stories.

In essence, "Bridging Realities" is not merely a research endeavor. It seeks to empower policymakers, NGOs, urban planners, and social welfare experts with a nuanced understanding of homelessness. By challenging prevailing narratives and offering a clearer picture, we hope to inspire a renewed commitment to addressing and understanding this pressing issue.

## 2. Problem Statement  
We aim to investigate changing patterns related to homelessness from 2015 to 2022 by conducting a thorough numerical analysis of homeless counts across diverse demographics such as age, gender, race, and state. Utilizing clustering, association pattern mining, and classification models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting), we seek to identify underlying patterns and factors significantly influencing homelessness.

Additionally, our study involves a text analysis of news titles related to homelessness from left-wing, neutral, and right-wing media categories. Employing sentiment analysis (BERT), word frequency, and topic modeling (LDA), we aim to assess media portrayals of homelessness across political wings. Furthermore, we seek to assess the alignment between Internet news portrayals by state and the actual circumstances of homelessness.

## 3. Related Work  
In recent research, machine learning and artificial intelligence have been harnessed to model complex systems, particularly within the context of homelessness. One study employs these technologies to predict returns to homelessness, examining numerous possible allocations of households to homeless services and generating reentry predictions for each combination of household and service [1]. Additionally, it explores mathematical and theoretical optimization possibilities for the allocation process and investigates how predictions can enhance the understanding of homeless service efficacy, focusing on the case of St. Louis, MO, USA.

Another study contributes to addressing various critical social issues, including homelessness, through the development of data-driven algorithmic solutions. Specifically, it seeks to mitigate homelessness by devising equitable policies and data-driven strategies to connect individuals with appropriate resources, ensuring a higher likelihood of a safe and stable exit from homelessness [2].

Our study is split into two parts. We first perform numerical analysis of data that consists of counts of homeless people across different demographics like age, gender, race, state, etc. We employ various algorithms like clustering, association pattern mining, and classification models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to understand underlying patterns in the data and factors that significantly influence homelessness.

The latter part of our study focuses on analyzing media headline data related to "homeless," i.e., text analysis of news titles scraped from news websites belonging to three different media categoriesâ€”left-wing, neutral, and right-wing. We perform sentiment analysis (BERT), word frequency analysis, and topic modeling (LDA) to assess media depiction of homelessness by each political wing. We finally compare the analyses from both parts, numerical and text, to discern the relationship between media sentiments and the actual state of homelessness.

# 5. Experiment

## 5.1 Section 1: Numerical Analysis

### 5.1.1 Data Acquisition - Homeless Count Data
The dataset utilized in this research project was acquired from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The dataset comprises Point-In-Time (PIT) counts collected by Continuums of Care (CoCs) from 2007 to 2022. 

> *"PIT counts are unduplicated one-night estimates of homeless populations, encompassing both sheltered and unsheltered individuals. These counts are conducted annually nationwide during the final week of January. CoCs represent local planning bodies responsible for coordinating a comprehensive range of homelessness services within specific geographic areas, which can encompass cities, counties, metropolitan areas, or entire states"* [3].

### 5.1.2 Data Visualization

#### (a) Trend
1. **Trend of Overall Count**
   - The count of homelessness has not significantly reduced over the years.
   - A dip in 2021 is observed due to data collection issues post-pandemic.
2. **Trend Categorized by Age**
   - More homeless adults than children (under 18).
3. **Trend Categorized by Gender**
   - There are more homeless males than females.
   - The count for other genders is very low compared to males and females.
4. **Trend Categorized by Race**
   - **Before Normalizing:**
     - White and Black populations are most affected.
     - The White population shows higher absolute counts due to their larger share of the total population (76%).
     - Black populations face disproportionately high counts, driven by factors such as systemic racism, unfair incarceration, and drug addiction.
   - **After Normalizing:**
     - Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islanders, Black, American Indian, and Alaskan Native populations are most affected.
     - The normalized data reveals that the White population is less impacted in comparison.
     - Patterns persist across all years.
5. **Trend Categorized by Type of Homelessness (Sheltered vs. Unsheltered)**
   - Sheltered counts are decreasing, while unsheltered counts are increasing, indicating a worsening issue.

#### (b) Distribution of Data for Each Year (2015-2022)
- Distribution assessed using histograms and boxplots after applying log transformation.
- Log transformation normalized the data distribution, as shown in Appendix A and B.

#### (c) Variability Across Years
- Side-by-side boxplots reveal consistent variability in homeless counts across years.
- Homelessness has not shown significant improvement since 2015.

#### (d) Visualization by State
1. **Trends by State (Across Years):**
   - California and New York consistently show worse homelessness counts compared to other states.
   - Likely causes include high cost of living, violence, and drug abuse.
2. **2022 Homeless Counts (US Map):**
   - California and New York demonstrate significantly higher homelessness counts in 2022.
